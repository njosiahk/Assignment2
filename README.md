# Project's Name

We are creating a game website for one of our favourite games of all time- Valorant. We have been playing this multi-player shooting game ever since its release in 2020. However, we can see and feel that the player base for the game is decreasing and the game is not as popular as it used to be. Thus, we wanted to create a website for it with many new added interactive features.

# Design Process

My target audience of this website would be to the upcoming generation of gamers. With the introduction of many other new shooting games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Valorant is no longer as popular as it used to be as the upcoming generation of gamers are moving on to the newer shooting games.
After doing some research, we found that this is because new players find the game difficult to navigate and the characters’ abilities confusing. We also found that the guns’ skins might be a little too expensive for some players.
We hope that this website would be able to re-introduce and show how fun and enjoyable Valorant can still be for the upcoming new generation of gamers. We hope that they can give this game a try and another chance. We also hope that Valorant will be able to get more recognition and love from the upcoming new generation of gamers.  
We feel that our project is the best way to help this game achieve its deserved recognition and attention from the upcoming new generation of gamers. This is because not only will our website contain 3 interactive mini games (Blast-Em, Duos and Puzzle) to attract the target audience, it will also be very informative and can provide more information on Valorant. For example, we have a News & Update page so that users can familiarise themselves with the current game changes, news and meta. We also have an Agent page so that users can know, understand, connect and familiarize themselves with all the agents in the game. We also have an arsenal page in our website where it shows every single weapon in the game so as to attract the users’ attention and arouse their interest. Last but not least, users can play 3 interactive games through this website and can have a chance for them to be shown in the leaderboards for other players to see! This can motivate users to be competitive so that they can FLEX their scores and moves to their friends. They can also redeem a promo code to utilize in-game and get skin discounts. 
Therefore, we wanted to create a website for Valorant in hopes that it will make the game popular once again and also allow users to have fun while learning more about the game- Valorant.

# User Stories

• As a secondary 2 student, I want to perform an action so that when I click on the guns I like, it can allow me to be able to see the features of the weapon such as the fire rate, the fire damage and the accuracy of it.
• As a secondary 3 student, I would like to be able to see my name on the top 5 leader board after playing the interactive game in the website.
• As a secondary 1 student, I want to know more about the game via this website so that I can consider if it is worth my time to play this game.
